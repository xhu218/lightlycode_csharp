# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 5, Managed and Unmanaged Resources

This chapter contains the following code samples:

* DisposableSample (*IDisposable* interface, *using* statement, finalizer)
* PointerPlayground (using pointers with C#, *unsafe* keyword)
* PointerPlayground2 (adding a struct)
* QuickArray (quick sorting using pointers, *stackalloc* keyword)
* PlatformInvokeSample (invoking native methods from C#)

> The *PlatformInvokeSample* requires Windows because of the native method invoked, all other samples run on Windows and Linux.

To build and run the .NET Core samples, please install
* Visual Studio 2017 with the .NET Core workload

Please download and install the tools from [.NET Core downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows).
