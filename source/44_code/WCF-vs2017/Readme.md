    * RoomReservationContracts (entity types and interface contracts)
    * RoomReservationData (Entity Framework Core)
    * RoomReservationService (service implementing the RoomReservation contracts)
    * RoomReservationHost (custom host using ServiceHost)
    * RoomReservationWebServiceHost (custom host using WebServiceHost)
    * RoomReservationClient (WPF client applicaiton using the WCF service)
    * RoomReservationClientSharedAssembly (WPF client application using the same contract assembly as the server)

    * ClientApp (client application using InstanceContext and CallbackHandler)
* DuplexCommunication
    * MessageService (service using a duplex channel, GetCallbackChannel)
    * DuplexHost (host using wsDualHttpBinding)

WCF needs (at least the server part) the full .NET Framework.

To build and run the .NET Core samples, please install
* Visual Studio 2017 with the .NET Core workload

Please download and install the tools from [.NET Core downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).
