# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 9, Delegates, Lambda, and Events

This chapter contains the following code samples:

* GetAStringDemo (declaring a *delegate* to a simple method)
* SimpleDelegates (declaring and instantiating delegates)
* BubbleSorter (Sort method using a Func<T> delegate)
* MulticastDelegates (invoking multiple methods with a single delegate)
* LambdaExpressions (creating lambda expressions)
* AnonymousMethods (using the *delegate* keyword to declare an anonymous method)
* EventsSample (subscribing and publishing events, *event* keyword)
* WeakEvents (using IWeakEventListener)

> The sample WeakEvents needs the assembly WindowsBase, and thus need the full .NET Framework and only runs on Windows. All other samples run on Windows and Linux.

To build and run the .NET Core samples, please install
* Visual Studio 2017 with the .NET Core workload

Please download and install the tools from [.NET Core downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows).
