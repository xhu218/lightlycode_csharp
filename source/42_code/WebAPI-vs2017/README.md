# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 42, ASP.NET Web API

This chapter contains these samples:

* Book Service Sample (offering in-memory data from a Web API service using ASP.NET Core)
* Book Service Async Sample (similar to the Book Service Sample, but offering async methods from the controller and use Entity Framework Core 1.0 )
* Book Service Client App (making use of the HttpClient and JSON.NET to access the Web API services)

The Book Service Sample makes use of Swagger (Swashbuckle 6.0.0-beta902) that is compatible with .NET Core 1.0/1.1 and available on NuGet.

The OData Library for .NET Core is still not available on NuGet. I'm planning to have a sample when .NET Core 2.0 is available - and hopefully ODAta as well. [See](https://github.com/OData/WebApi/tree/vNext/vNext "OData WebAPI")

To build and run the .NET Core samples, please install
* Visual Studio 2017 with the .NET Core workload

Please download and install the tools from [.NET Core downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).
